reality club

Just like a certain motorbike gang from Charming
Or you're looking for the old ultraviolence
You're trouble, yes I knew
Right from the start

And the labyrinth I thought I knew
Rearranged to shape anew
At amazement of the excitement
That once rang true

hy club
And if I was a fool for you
I'd wait 500 million hours
On a park bench out on the moon
But in full view of what you are
You're a goddess, you're my rock star

hallucination club
